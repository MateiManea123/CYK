# CYK
The CYK algorithm (Cocke–Younger–Kasami) is a dynamic programming algorithm used to determine whether a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). It works by breaking the string into smaller substrings and checking for possible derivations using the grammar's production rules. The algorithm builds a table where each cell represents a substring of the input and contains the possible non-terminal symbols that can derive it.
